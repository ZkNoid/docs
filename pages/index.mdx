<a href={"https://zknoid.io/"}>ZkNoid</a> is a game platform where all the game interactions are reproducible in ZK circuit 
and can prove the correct gaming process without revealing the player strategy

This allows competitions to be held without cheating or bots possibility. 
Fair leaderbords, winning real valuables for gaming skills â€“ this is all about ZkNoid project


## How it works
### Arkanoid like game

Game process is divided into ticks - N times per second user input like arrow pressing is processed by ZK circuit.
The whole game result is clearly defined by the user input. 
As displayed game is synchronized with ZK circuit that's generated recursively during the game the final proof verifies the fairness of the whole game

Other game types will be introduced later

## Technologies

Project leverages `Mina Protocol`'s unique zero knowledge technology. 
Smart contracts powered by ZK generate the proof that is validated in Mina network and only fair players are recoreded in leaderboard

Debug mode shows frontend and contracts state synchronization
