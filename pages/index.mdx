## How it works
### Arkanoid like game

Game process is divided into ticks - N times per second user input like arrow pressing is processed by ZK circuit.
The whole game result is clearly defined by the user input. 
As displayed game is synchronized with ZK circuit that's generated recursively during the game the final proof verifies the fairness of the whole game

Other game types will be introduced later
