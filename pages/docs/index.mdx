## Overview
<Image src={'/DocsBlueSnake.svg'} alt='logo' width={200} height={200} style={{paddingTop: '10px'}} ></Image>

<a href={"https://zknoid.io/"}>ZkNoid</a> is a gaming platform where all the game interactions are reproducible in ZK circuit 
and can prove the correct gaming process without revealing the player strategy

This allows competitions to be held without cheating or bots possibility. 
Fair leaderbords, winning real valuables for gaming skills – this is all about ZkNoid project


## How it works
### Arkanoid game

#### Rules

In Ankanoid, your objective is to break all the bricks on the screen using a bouncing ball and a platform. 
You can control the game by using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the platform. 
You need to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen.

#### Implementation
Game process is divided into ticks - N times per second user input like arrow pressing is processed by ZK circuit.
The whole game result is clearly defined by the user input. Cart has acceleration that affects ball when touching.
As displayed game is synchronized with ZK circuit that's generated recursively during the game the final proof verifies the fairness of the whole game

#### Technologies

Project leverages `Mina Protocol`'s unique zero knowledge technology. 
Smart contracts powered by ZK recursively accumulate the proof that is validated in Mina network and only fair players are recoreded in leaderboard

Debug mode shows frontend and contracts state synchronization. Read more about verification [here](/docs/arkanoid_details/game_verification)

### Randzu game

A multiplayer game that is similar to tic-tac-toe. 
Leverages power of <a href="https://protokit.dev/">Protokit</a> to enable multiplayer, gasless and fast transactions.

#### Matchmaking

Matchmaking allows opponent to find each other and start game once opponent is found

  <source src={'/randzu_multiplayer_enc.mp4'} type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>


#### Rules

Randzu is a game played on a 15x15 grid, similar to tic-tac-toe. 
Two players take turns placing their mark, using balls of different collors. 
The goal is to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

#### Implementation

If background session is not enabled, each move requires a signature

  <source src={'/randzu_gameplay_short_enc.mp4'} type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Player can turn on background sessions. 
In this case a temporal keypair is created on front-end that signs transactions without user interruption.
This makes game UX just like in Web2 games. [Learn more about background sessions](https://zknoid.medium.com/how-protokit-can-revolutionize-on-chain-gaming-how-to-cook-it-to-implement-a-multiplayer-game-955dbb2442ac)


## Benefits

ZkNoid offers benefits for different type of users

__Gamers, speedrunners__ receive souvenir NFT for being in leaderboard on the fair place amoung other fair players


__High skilled players, enjoyers__ monetize your skills or game luck. Pay for playing in a competition and receive payout based on your leaderboard place


__Projects__ run competitions with private leaderboard among users with reward based on skills and spent time to keep users interested.

## Project state

Project is actively developing. <br />
Demo app in alpha version based on deployed Protokit version can be accessed here – https://app.zknoid.io/ <br />
Protokit network is deployed to https://protokit.zknoid.io/graphql


App also can be launched locally using

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid
cd zknoid

# ensures you have the right node js version
nvm use
pnpm install
```

### Games implemented

__Arkanoid game__: recursive proofs, game verification, cart acceleration that affects ball on collision, leaderboard, competitions creation and funding

__Randzu game__: multiplayer, matchmaking, background gasless sessions, paid competitions, game verification.

## For developers

ZkNoid provides SDK allowing developers to bootstrap their games using ready infrastructure and integrate them to the project economy. 
Framework presents both on-chain and off-chain reusable parts. Such as
- Funds bridging and unbridging to the game network
- Competitions integration
- Matchmaking, multiplayer support
- Background transactions using session keys to not interrupt user for transactions confirmation
- Pseudorandomness, noises
- Collisions calculation
- Recursive proofs calculation support on front-end

Read more about SDK and custom game implementation in the [developer's section of the docs](/docs/sdk)

## Social features

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Social features are currently in progress
</Callout>

ZkNoid brings social moment to the gaming that is impemented as following features

- Friends list. User has it's own friends list and can send or approve / declain friend requests
- Chats. Competitions have their chats where players can communicate, find friends or send in-game tokens.
- Micropayments. Users can send messages with tokens to each other like to wish happy birthday

To protect chats from spam, only users with certain in-game balance are eligible to use chats and send friend requests
If user tries to spam or scam other players, players can vote to soft-ban user from social features or ban completely.
