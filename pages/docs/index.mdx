and can prove the correct gaming process without revealing the player strategy

This allows competitions to be held without cheating or bots possibility. 
Fair leaderbords, winning real valuables for gaming skills â€“ this is all about ZkNoid project


## How it works
### Arkanoid game

The whole game result is clearly defined by the user input. 
As displayed game is synchronized with ZK circuit that's generated recursively during the game the final proof verifies the fairness of the whole game
