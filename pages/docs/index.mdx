Zero knowledge proof technologies are widely known and they are becoming an integral part of the products we use.
And that is for a good reason. They're bringing an absolutely new dimensions of the space of making trustless systems. 
Don‚Äôt believe it, prove it!

<a href={"https://zknoid.io/"}>ZkNoid</a> project is a home for provable gaming.
On the platform you can try yourself the cutting edge games utilizing Zero-Knowledge proofs or build one using the provided infrastructure

### Benefits
Explore the world of fair gaming powered by cryptography. 
Here are the some benefits you can try

**üôà¬†Information hiding.** Imagine a battle where player can attack an opponent without revealing his hero‚Äôs skills. Zero knowledge proofs can prove literally everything while preserving the next level of data privacy control

**ü§ù Transparency and Trustworthiness.** Provable games allow players to independently verify the fairness of any outcome. This transparency helps to build trust among players, as they know that the game cannot be rigged.

**üìú Immutable Records**. Using blockchain technology, game outcomes and proof verifications are recorded in an immutable ledger, ensuring that none of the parties involved can alter the results afterwards.

üí∏¬†**Low fees**. Games on ZkNoid platform require to verify not the game logic execution BUT the cryptographic PROOF of the game logic execution. Block creators spend less effort on execution making the games playing cheaper

ü•û¬†**High scalability**. Cryptography allows to connect different ZK native networks using proofs. Games can launch their own appchain solutions like protokit or use Zeko. Matchmaking can be moved to appchain to be free for players. Assets from Zeko network may be used in game

ZkNoid project aims to on-ramp hundreds of projects to Zk-Proofs and grow new ZK-native games. Offering the required layers for easy integration of provable game mechanics in an user-friendly way, ZkNoid acts as the first publisher for games with zero knowledge support

## ZkNoid History and Future plans

### History

ZkNoid journey into Zk gaming development started at 2023 in november in ETHGlobal Istanbul hackathon. Team provide high complicated but well-known arcade game: Arkanoid. This game was became the first game with zk provable process on Mina Protocol and gave the development team a victory. That makes the beginning of the project ZkNoid. Since november we faced on with a lot of challenges during development and figure it out. The new era of gaming is started: zk-provable, fairness and fun. Our project and team growing every day and now we can offer to the Web3 gamers more provable games and for developers opportunity to build games using ZkNoid SDK, which provide  ‚Äúeasy to deploy‚Äù process. We also creating a lot of education content like guides and articles, researching and build day by day the provable future.

### Roadmap

Today, the main goals of the ZkNoid application are to launch on the Mainnet with a L1 Lottery Game,  attract third-party developers to build on our SDK, development and launch project Token with Order Book. The full roadmap is as follows:

![Docs_Roadmap.png](/Docs_Roadmap.png)

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Lottery L1** 

The Lottery game pretend to become the first game with zk-proof on Mina Mainnet. It will be the honest lottery in Web3 world. To ensure a fair playing process ZkNoid development team is going to integrate VRF technology into the winning number generation process and conduct an audit with the help of a third party company. The game will be audited by the Extropy audit team.

![Roadmap 2.png](/Roadmap_2.png)

**2Ô∏è‚É£ SDK & Guides** 

Our main goal is to help and provide zk-provable infrastructure for Mina game developers. We are working on improving our SDK to make it more intuitive and easier to use. We also expect more educational content, guides, and workshops for the developers in the community.

![Roadmap 3.png](/Roadmap_3.png)

3Ô∏è‚É£ **ETHGlobal Hackatones**

ZkNoid will be co-hosting ETHGlobal hackathons with MinaProtocol. We will provide tracks with prizes at ETHGlobal Online Hackathon in August and ETHGlobal Singapore in September 2024. Hackers who use the ZkNoid SDK have the opportunity to win rewards and get development support to onramp their games to the Mina Ecosystem.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Token & Order Book**

Can‚Äôt wait to trade tokens on MinaProtocol? Order book is here to rock the Mina community and break the ice of DeFi!

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Clicker game: play-to-earn**

Initial token distribution will be made by the ‚Äúproof of tap‚Äù online clicker game with play-to earn mechanism
