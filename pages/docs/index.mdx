## Overview
<Image src={'/zknoid.svg'} alt='logo' width={100} height={100} style={{paddingTop: '10px'}} ></Image>

<a href={"https://zknoid.io/"}>ZkNoid</a> is a game platform where all the game interactions are reproducible in ZK circuit 
and can prove the correct gaming process without revealing the player strategy

This allows competitions to be held without cheating or bots possibility. 
Fair leaderbords, winning real valuables for gaming skills â€“ this is all about ZkNoid project


## How it works
### Arkanoid game

#### Rules

In Ankanoid, your objective is to break all the bricks on the screen using a bouncing ball and a platform. 
You can control the game by using the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the platform. 
You need to bounce the ball and prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen.

#### Implementation
Game process is divided into ticks - N times per second user input like arrow pressing is processed by ZK circuit.
The whole game result is clearly defined by the user input. Cart has acceleration that affects ball when touching.
As displayed game is synchronized with ZK circuit that's generated recursively during the game the final proof verifies the fairness of the whole game

#### Technologies

Project leverages `Mina Protocol`'s unique zero knowledge technology. 
Smart contracts powered by ZK recursively accumulate the proof that is validated in Mina network and only fair players are recoreded in leaderboard

Debug mode shows frontend and contracts state synchronization. Read more about verification [here](/docs/arkanoid_details/game_verification)

### Randzu game

A multiplayer game that is similar to tic-tac-toe. 
Leverages power of <a href="https://protokit.dev/">Protokit</a> to enable multiplayer, gasless and fast transactions.

#### Matchmaking

Matchmaking allows opponent to find each other and start game once opponent is found

#### Rules

Randzu is a game played on a 15x15 grid, similar to tic-tac-toe. The goal is to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally.
Two players take turns placing their mark, using balls of different collors. 
The goal is to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#### Implementation

If background session is not enabled, each move requires a signature

  <source src={'/randzu_gameplay_short.mp4'} type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Player can turn on background sessions. 
In this case a temporal keypair is created on front-end that will sign transactions without user interruption.
This makes game UX just like in Web2 games. [Learn more about background sessions](https://zknoid.medium.com/how-protokit-can-revolutionize-on-chain-gaming-how-to-cook-it-to-implement-a-multiplayer-game-955dbb2442ac)

## Project state

Project is actively developing. 
Public deployment of actual app demo is blocked because proto-kit project is not ready for public deployment yet. 
App requires to be cloned and launched localy until proto-kit is ready:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid
cd zknoid

# ensures you have the right node js version
nvm use
pnpm install
```

### Games implemented

__Arkanoid game__: recursive proofs, game verification, cart acceleration that affects ball on collision, leaderboard, competitions creation and funding 

__Randzu game__: multiplayer, matchmaking, background gasless sessions, paid competitions, game verification
