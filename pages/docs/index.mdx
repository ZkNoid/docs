ZkNoid is a zk-native game development studio building Web3 games powered and verified by zero-knowledge proofs. Our mission is to bring provable fairness, true ownership, and transparent mechanics to gaming and create engaging experiences that are trustless as they are fun.

At its core, ZkNoid combines innovative game design with cutting-edge cryptography, allowing us to deliver gameplay that is:

- Fast & Responsive – Optimistic UIs and hybrid architectures make our games feel Web2-native.
- Trustless & Fair – Zero-knowledge proofs ensure that game logic can’t be tampered with, providing verifiable fairness.
- Cross-chain Ready – Seamless onboarding across Mina, Sui, EVM, and beyond.
- Player-Centric – Accessibility and fun always come first, with intuitive onboarding and gameplay loops designed for all gamers, not just crypto natives.

### Why Zero-Knowledge in Gaming?

Most blockchain games struggle with the tradeoff between speed and trust:

- Web2 games are fast but centralized.
- Web3 games are secure but often slow and clunky.

ZkNoid bridges this gap with ZKPs, letting players enjoy smooth gameplay while knowing every move, every battle, and every outcome is verifiably correct.

This means:

- Secure, tamper-proof gameplay.
- Possibility of new gameplay mechanics.
- Full transparency of game algorithms without sacrificing playability.

## Vision & Core Principles

### Our Vision

We envision a gaming ecosystem where:

- Web2-quality speed meets web3-grade trust.
- Players know their progress, victories, and rewards are verifiably fair.
- Onboarding is simple enough for anyone, whether you’re a crypto-native or touching web3 for the first time.
- Developers have the infrastructure to create ZK-powered games without reinventing the wheel.
- Communities shape the worlds they play in, co-creating the lore, mechanics, and future of their favorite games.

In short: We want to make web3 gaming as fun and accessible as web2, while unlocking entirely new mechanics made possible by ZK proofs.

### Core Principles

1. Fun First
   - Gameplay must always come before tech. Blockchain and ZKPs are tools to enhance experience, not barriers to it.
2. Verifiable Fairness
   - Every outcome, from crafting to battles, is backed by cryptographic guarantees. Players never have to just “trust” a server, they can verify it.
3. Seamless Experience
   - Optimistic UIs, multi-chain wallets, and social logins keep gameplay smooth and onboarding easy. Web3 complexity stays under the hood.
4. Openness & Interoperability
   - Built to work across ecosystems: Mina, Sui, EVMs, and more. ZkNoid is not locked into a single chain.
5. Community-Driven Growth
   - Games thrive when players feel ownership. ZkNoid embraces open development, lore-building, and active collaboration with our community.
6. Experimentation at the Edge
   - ZK is a young and evolving field. ZkNoid is a space to experiment with new mechanics pushing the limits of what games can be.

### The Road Ahead

ZkNoid isn’t just building games. We’re building a foundation for ZK-powered entertainment universe where:

- All games are provably fair.
- Players own their progress.
- Developers can easily plug into shared ZK infrastructure.

The endgame? A universe of fun, verifiable, and interconnected ZK games.

### ZkNoid History

ZkNoid journey into Zk gaming development started at 2023 in november in ETHGlobal Istanbul hackathon. Team provide high complicated but well-known arcade game: Arkanoid. This game was became the first game with zk provable process on Mina Protocol and gave the development team a victory. That makes the beginning of the project ZkNoid. Since november we faced on with a lot of challenges during development and figure it out. The new era of gaming is started: zk-provable, fairness and fun. Our project and team growing every day and now we can offer to the Web3 gamers more provable games and for developers opportunity to build games using ZkNoid SDK, which provide “easy to deploy” process. We also creating a lot of education content like guides and articles, researching and build day by day the provable future.

## Stay it touch with ZkNoid

Do you have any more questions about our project? Would you like to collaborate or build something using the ZkNoid SDK? Or may be you just want to discuss development using zk technologies, you can find us on social media and ask your questions, and we hear it out your ideas. Our team consists of open-minded and enthusiastic people who will be happy to have a conversation with you.
