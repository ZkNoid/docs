### Next JS SDK

ZkNoid is a modular platform that can be easily extended with custom games. 
Every game consist of front-end and chain-end part.

The core of ZkNoid framework is the github repository — link.
Framework is divided into 4 packages — sdk, games, store and chain.

To start building with ZkNoid you need to clone the repo and launch the store:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZkNoid/store zknoid
cd zknoid
 
# ensures you have the right node js version
# !important! Without this step the app may not work!
nvm use

pnpm install
# Runs the game store
pnpm env:inmemory dev
```
