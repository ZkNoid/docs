### Reimplementing Randzu game UI with ZkNoid SDK

Using ZkNoid infrastructure thrue the SDK allows to easily bootstrap a game. 
In this example we will explore the process of Randzu game creation
ZkGame consists of two parts: ui and on-chain program. 

#### Get started

To create a game you need to clone the ZkNoid project repository and set up the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid
cd zknoid
 
# ensures you have the right node js version
nvm use
pnpm install
```

To launch the platform command `pnpm dev` can be used

Then open project folder using your favorite code editor

```bash
cd ../
code zknoid
```

Games UI is stored inside `apps/web` folder. There are already UI for arkanoid and randzu games.

#### Creating game interface

Create a `randzu2` directory inside `apps/web` folder. 
Create file named `config.ts` inside. This file will store game meta information

```ts filename="apps/web/randzu2/config.ts"
import { createZkNoidGameConfig } from "@/lib/createConfig";

// In this example we will focus on UI, and will use ready contracts
// Contracts implementation described in next article
import { RandzuLogic } from "zknoid-chain-dev";

export const randzu2Config =
    createZkNoidGameConfig({
        id: 'randzu2',
        name: 'Randzu2',
        description: 'Two players take turns placing pieces on the board attempting to create lines of 5 of their own color',
        image: '/randzu.jpeg',
        runtimeModules: {
          RandzuLogic
        },
        page: undefined,
    });
```

Implementation is in progress
