### SDK

ZkNoid is an extandable platform that provides SDK for developers that allows to easily create and integrate their game. 
ZkGame can be created by implementing engine contracts or by using game engine SDKs

#### SDK contracts
SDK includes a set of _engine_ smartcontracts that can be inherited to enable specific features.<br/>
Engine contracts cover the core ZK gaming concepts. Contracts integration is the most flexible way of integration
allowing to implement advanced provable games logic while inheriting useful platform features


##### Competitions and leaderboard system
Allows to integrate and manage free and paid competitions in the game. For competitions leaderboard is created
- Engine contract: [engine/GameHub.ts](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/engine/GameHub.ts)
- Usage example: [ArkanoidGameHub.ts](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/ArkanoidGameHub.ts)


##### Matchmaking system
Allows to integrate players queue, opponent finding that makes possible PvP games
- Engine contract: [engine/MatchMaker.ts](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/engine/MatchMaker.ts)
- Usage example: [RandzuLogic.ts](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/RandzuLogic.ts)


##### Proof of shuffle
_To be announced_


#### Game engine SDKs
Allows to use game engines to create embedded ZkGames. <br/>
Wraps base ZK game concepts or custom contracts and allows to use them inside such game engines like Unity, Cocos2d, Godot.
