# Extropy.io audit

## Audit dates
19/08/2024-11/10/2024
 
## Audit conclusion
There is no evidence of malicious or untrustworthy code by the developers. The reported issue that 
should be noted by users of the system is issue 4.4, where in the unlikely event of the back end being 
permanently unavailable, an replacement would need to be created, which is possible though time 
consuming.
