## Network architecture

Mina network has several limitations that makes it hard to implement on-chain gaming.
Mina zkApps has limitation of 8 memory slots per smartcontract. 
It's complicated to implement gasless transactions and block production is slower that required for realtime games.
To solve this challenges our games use both Mina and [Protokit](https://protokit.dev/) networks

### What is Protokit

Protokit is a product developed by Mina Protocol team. 
Basically it’s a tool that allows to set up your own app-specific Zk Rollup network. 
This network is separated from the Mina network. 
It’s impossible to access Mina zkApps – the only contracts exist in the network are defined by network developer and known as runtime modules. 
As only they are presented in the network they can be identified by names instead of addresses.

The only connection between Mina and app specific networks is bridging. 
Mina token can be bridged to an internal user balance in an app smartcontract. 
Then other smartcontracts can check user balance and decrease it to pay for actions. 
For now only MINA native currency can be bridged. 
However it will be possible to bridge Mina tokens when the token inside Mina network is standardised. 
In this case user deposit amounts and token infos will be stored inside app network.

### Why Protokit

The app network works off the Mina chain but captures state changes and pushes proofs to the Mina network. 
It solves mina limitations of storing smart contract state in not more than 8 slots of 32-bytes size while inheriting the L1 network security. 
Allows to handy implement such features as leaderboards, players waiting room for matchmaking.

Another usefull fact about app network – you can decide whether to charge fee from users for transaction or to make transactions completely free. 

Gassless transactions are crucial for gaming UX.
Now a session key can be created on frontend, registered by user and used to sign game transactions in background without interruptions for transactions confirmation.

### Networks interplay

To cook both Mina and Protokit app networks inside one application we decided to consider Protokit network as a game room network. 
User connects to it only when enters the game round. If game round is payed and required a fee to play, assets are bridged before entering
