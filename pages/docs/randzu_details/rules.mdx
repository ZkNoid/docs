## Randzu game rules

Randzu is a game played on a 15x15 grid, similar to tic-tac-toe. 
Two players take turns placing their mark, either an "X" or an "O" in an empty cell on the grid. 
The goal is to get five of your marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The game continues until one player achieves the winning pattern or until the entire grid is filled without a winner, resulting in a draw.
