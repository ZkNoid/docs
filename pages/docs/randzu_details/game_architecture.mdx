## Ranzu game architecture overview

Ranzu is a multiplayer game and it involves matchmaking.
Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/ZkNoid/zknoid/blob/develop/packages/chain/src/MatchMaker.ts)

Players pool is divided into rounds. Round occures every 5 blocks passed in networks. 
Users who want to play needs to re-register in rounds until opponent is not found. 


Matchmaking occures when user calls `register` function on the players pool for the latest round. 
Firstly it checks that user can participate in game and is not already registered in the round.
Then it registes user session key so game transactions can be executed without confirmation.

Then pool queue is checked. If there is an opponent, he will be removed from queue and a game with current player is initialized.
If there're no opponents in the queue, user is registered in the round pool. Then if opponent joined, he will initialize game with you
