## Audit conclusion

There is no evidence of malicious or untrustworthy code by the developers. The reported issue that
should be noted by users of the system is issue 4.4, where in the unlikely event of the back end being
permanently unavailable, an replacement would need to be created, which is possible though time
consuming.
