## Thimblerig game rules

Objective:
The objective of the game is to correctly guess the location of a hidden ball under one of three thimbles.

Gameplay:
1. Two players participate in each round of the game. One player hides a ball under one of three thimbles, and the other player attempts to guess the location of the ball.

2. The hiding player places ball under one of three thimbles trying to confuse the guessing player.

3. The guessing player selects one of the thimbles, trying to guess which thimble conceals the ball.

4. The hiding player then reveals whether the ball is under the chosen thimble.

Scoring:
- If the guessing player correctly identifies the thimble containing the ball, they win 2/3 of the round's budget.
- If the guessing player guesses incorrectly, they receive 1/3 of the round's budget as a consolation prize.
- The hiding player receives nothing if the ball's location is not revealed by them.
