## Orbirium

### Description

Orbirium is a web3 ide crafter and the prequel to Wizard Battle.

It introduces the celestial forge of Arcane Orbs (named Orbirium), combining idle gameplay mechanics with zk-verified fairness and a unique multi-layer architecture.

This section breaks down the gameplay, architecture, and developer tools behind Orbirium.

Network layer: Sui + Zeko

### Overview

At the dawn of magic, before wizards dueled in the Arena, there was the Forge of Orbirium - a mystical construct that created the first Orbs.

Each Orb embodies a branch of magic: chaos, fire, water, light, nature, and illusion. Crafted within Orbirium, they channel unique abilities that shape the future of Wizard Battle.

The core crafting loop of Orbirium is built around:

- Collecions resources through active taps and passive upgrades.
- Unlocking and crafting new items to progress through the resource tree.
- Upgrading and refining your production flows to optimize output
- Crafting as many Black Orbs as possible to climb the leaderboard.

Orbirium is idle yet strategic: your choices in crafting and upgrades determine your long-term progression.

### Architecture

Orbirium is built on a three-layer architecture:

1. Application Layer - User-facing interface with multi-chain wallets and optimistic UI for instant feedback.
2. Sui Layer - Execution layer that verifies actions and manages game state every Sui block (~2s).
3. Zeko Layer - Settlement layer that finalizes game results with zero-knowledge proofs for cryptographic integrity.

**Application Layer**

- Optimistic UI: User actions update instantly before on-chain confirmation. If a transaction fails, progress reverts to match the verified on-chain state.
- Multi-Chain Wallets: Supports Mina, Sui, and EVM networks through:
  - _Mysten dApp Kit_ - Sui wallet integration
  - _Reown AppKit_ - Multi-chain onboarding (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin)
  - _Mina Signer_ - Mina transaction signing
  - _Wagmi_ - EVM wallet & contract interactions

This enables seamless cross-chain play, flexible wallet options, and smooth user onboarding through social or email accounts.

**Sui Layer**

The Sui Layer acts as the execution engine for Orbirium.

Each player’s state consists of three arrays (21 values each):

- Resources: Current resource quantities
- RPS (Resources per Second): Resource generation rates
- Storage: Maximum capacity per resource

_Rules and Actions_

Every in-game action (click, upgrade, craft) applies a rule represented as three arrays that update the player’s state via simple addition:

```
new_resources = resources + rule_resources
new_rps       = rps + rule_rps
new_storage   = storage + rule_storage
```

For example:

- Click Rule: `[+1 wood]`
- Upgrade Rule: `[+1 orb, +0.1 stone/sec]`

**Anti-Cheat Protection**

To ensure fairness:

- One-Time Upgrades: Each upgrade can be used only once.
- Admin-Signed Rules: Every valid rule must be signed by Orbirium’s admin to prevent arbitrary state changes.

### Zeko Layer

The Zeko Layer serves as the settlement and verification layer.

All Sui actions are mirrored as zkPrograms that produce zero-knowledge proofs, confirming that every state update is valid without revealing sensitive data.

**Recursive Proofs**

Multiple actions are merged into a single, compressed proof (“proofs of proofs”) drastically reducing verification costs while maintaining full traceability.

Example:

```
p1, p2, p3 → P12 (validates p1 & p2) → P (validates P12 & p3)
```

Now, verifying `P` ensures all previous actions are valid.

### Silvana API Integration

The Silvana API connects Sui and Zeko by:

1. Collecting verified events from Sui,
2. Generating zk proofs that these actions occurred correctly,
3. Submitting those proofs to the Zeko zkApp for settlement.

This process transfers the game state securely from Sui to Zeko, ensuring final, tamper-proof results.
