## TileVille

Description
TileVille is a strategic city-building game on the Mina blockchain, where players construct and manage their own cities on the island of Nicobar using hexagonal tiles. 

The current tile types are trees, roads, and windmills. More tile types, such as residential, commercial, and industrial, will be introduced in future updates.


Rules
Players participate in competitions by paying an entry fee. During the competition, they construct their cities on the map, aiming to earn the highest score. To earn points, players have to connect the city center to the port with road tiles, place windmills on hills, and form parks with tree tiles.

Scoring mechanic:
- 1 point for each Road tile connected to the city Center.
- 3 points for each Port connected to the city Center with Roads.
- 1 point for each Wind Mill (3 points if it is on a hill) not adjacent to any other Wind Mill. 
- 5 points for each group of 3 connected Parks.

At the end, the top 3 players receive rewards distributed as 65%, 22%, and 13% of the total competition pool.
