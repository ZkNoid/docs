## Checkers

Checkers is a two-player game played on an 8x8 board. 
Players take turns moving their pieces diagonally forward, capturing opponent's pieces by jumping over them. 
A piece reaching the opponent's back row becomes a king and can move backward.

The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's pieces or by blocking them from moving
