## ZK gaming real life example

To explain what is ZK gaming let’s dive into how ZK proofs work. 
Imagine you’re a chess fan and you go to a chess club. 
Club teacher gave all the students a chessboard configuration for a homework and asked to checkmate in the minimum amount of moves playing against the same AI algorithm. 
You managed to finish game in 7 steps. It was so cool that your friend haven’t believed your result and asked to prove it.

The problem is, you can’t share your moves with your friend – he can then show the same steps on the next lesson and say he came up with the solution by himself. 
While arguing, your mutual friend came and said that he checkmated in 5 steps. 
You’re pretty sure that it’s impossible and asked to prove. But he refused to show his moves for the same reason

ZK proofs are here to help. 
You can create a black box — ZK circuit based on public data (initial chess configuration) and public algorithm (chess rules and bot AI algorithm). 
Then you can can put private data (your moves) into the box. 
Box will process the private data — apply you moves, verify you checkmated and give you proof that you checkmated using N moves.

This proof can’t be used to know your moves. 
However you can send this proof to your friends and they can use the verifier part of the blackbox to check you really checkmated in the exact number of moves.

All the students liked the idea and created proofs for their moves. 
They managed to create an internal scoreboard where all the scores are verifiably correct while nobody knows how other players achieved the result. 
It turned out that your result was the best, and the result of a mutual friend was fake

Check game is just a simple example of a game with provable game process. 
More interesting and complex games can be proved as well. 
In ZkNoid we're implementing a gaming platform where all the game state changing based on user input is proved
