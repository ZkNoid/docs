# Bigger Card game

| ! Under development |
| ------------------- |

Here we will implement simple card game using ZKnoid card SDK.
For this purpose we will use predefined poker cards and proof for them.

First lets create basic contract, that will extends CardGameBase. This class will give us usefull functions for shufling and decoding cards.

```ts
@runtimeModule()
export class BiggerCard
    extends CardGameBase<
        PokerCard,
        PokerEncryptedCard,
        PokerEncryptedDeck,
        Game
    >
    implements RuntimeModule<{}> {}
```

Then lets create class for game info, that will store all information about game. Next is a function, that increase waitNum, and update status if needed

```ts
export class Game extends Struct({
    id: UInt64, // Id of the game
    status: UInt64, // Game stage
    agrigatedPublicKey: PublicKey, // Sum of all players public key. It is needed for encryption
    encryptedDeck: PokerEncryptedDeck, // All cards in random order
    waitNum: UInt64, // Amount of players that participated at this stage
    firstPlayer: PublicKey, // First player address
    secondPlayer: PublicKey, // Second player address
    winner: PublicKey, // Winner of the game
}) {
    next(): void {
        this.waitNum = this.waitNum.add(1);
        const allPlayersMoved = this.waitNum.equals(MAX_PLAYERS);
        this.status = Provable.if(
            // This is a little workaround. Will be changed in the future
            allPlayersMoved,
            this.status.add(1),
            this.status
        );
        this.waitNum = Provable.if(allPlayersMoved, UInt64.zero, this.waitNum);
    }
}
```

And will add mapping from id, to game to our module

```ts
  @state() public games = StateMap.from<UInt64, Game>(UInt64, Game as any);
```

Now we will implement functions for our game.
First function to implement is a function, that will initiate game.

```ts
  @runtimeMethod()
  public participate(gameId: UInt64) {
    // Game game from contract
    let game = this.games.get(gameId).value;

    // Check that staus is init
    expect(game.status.equals(GameStatuses.INIT));

    // Add sender private key to agrigated public key
    const sender = this.transaction.sender.value;
    // console.log('Sender ', sender.toBase58());

    let pubKey = Provable.if(
      game.agrigatedPublicKey.isEmpty(),
      sender,
      game.agrigatedPublicKey,
    );
    let intialGroupValue = Provable.if(
      game.agrigatedPublicKey.isEmpty(),
      Group.zero,
      pubKey.toGroup(),
    );

    game.agrigatedPublicKey = PublicKey.fromGroup(
      intialGroupValue.add(sender.toGroup()),
    );

    game.firstPlayer = Provable.if(
      game.waitNum.equals(UInt64.from(0)),
      sender,
      game.firstPlayer,
    );
    game.secondPlayer = Provable.if(
      game.waitNum.equals(UInt64.from(1)),
      sender,
      game.secondPlayer,
    );
    game.id = gameId;

    game.next();

    this.games.set(gameId, game);
  }
```

Next function is a shuffle function. Here we will use \_shuffle function that will verify proof, and return new game deck.

```ts
  @runtimeMethod()
  public shuffle(gameId: UInt64, shuffleProof: PokerShuffleProof) {
    let game = this.games.get(gameId).value;

    expect(game.status.equals(GameStatuses.SETUP));

    // #TODO add checks
    const newEncryptedDeck = this._shuffle(shuffleProof);

    game.encryptedDeck = newEncryptedDeck;

    game.next();

    this.games.set(gameId, game);
  }
```

After shuffle we need to open first two cards. If first card is higher, than first player is winner, the second is winner otherwise(yeah, its not fair for first player. Life is not fair).
\_decrypt fucntion decrypt provided card with proof.

```ts
  @runtimeMethod()
  public openCardsFirstTwo(
    gameId: UInt64,
    firstProof: PokerDecryptProof,
    secodProof: PokerDecryptProof,
  ) {
    let game = this.games.get(gameId).value;
    expect(game.status.equals(GameStatuses.REVEAL));

    this._decrypt(game.encryptedDeck.cards[0], firstProof);
    this._decrypt(game.encryptedDeck.cards[1], secodProof);

    game.next();

    this.games.set(gameId, game);
  }
```

And now cards is decrypted, so we can easily decide who is winner.

```ts
  @runtimeMethod()
  public pickWinner(gameId: UInt64) {
    let game = this.games.get(gameId).value;
    expect(game.status.equals(GameStatuses.FINISHED));
    const firstCard = game.encryptedDeck.cards[0];
    const secondCard = game.encryptedDeck.cards[1];
    const firstCardDecoded = firstCard.toCard();
    const secondCardDecoded = secondCard.toCard();
    const firstWin = firstCardDecoded.value.greaterThanOrEqual(
      secondCardDecoded.value,
    );
    game.winner = Provable.if(firstWin, game.firstPlayer, game.secondPlayer);
    this.games.set(gameId, game);
  }
```
